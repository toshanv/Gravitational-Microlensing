# Gravitational-Microlensing
In gravitational microlensing, a star temporarily brightens when its light is focused by the gravitational field of another star that happens to be passing in front (from our perspective). In this project, you will fit microlensing models to observed light curves (brightness vs. time) in order to extract key parameters for microlensing events.
